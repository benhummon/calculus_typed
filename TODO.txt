# PDF output #

`pdflatex` complains about image PDFs declaring a "page group" of their own.

Differences between formats.

* Chapter titles use a period as a separator in Web output.
* What to call the Top/Introduction page.



# Jax #

Look through `jaxconfig`.



# Haskell #

There are some math commands, eg. `\Vector` and `\Ruler`, that must
take two arguments, but it would be nice if they could drop their
braces when an argument is empty.

Allow `&` and `\\` to appear in unsafes.

Can I remove system calls?

Or at least do better at checking the system call exit codes?



# Upstream Bugs #

Look into MathJax alignment / spacing bug.



# Good Habits #

Spell check!

Audit `Math.hs`.

Checkup on `\unsafe` usage.

Look through comments in book sources.

Look through comments in TeX files.

Look carefully at output of a `calc2web-rebuild`.



# Longer Term #

Consider using a different math font.

What can I do about line widths in PDF output that display inconsistently?

Allow link anchors within pages?

Look into making jax load faster - can I pre-generate math as images?

Consider making a custom `\mapsfrom` command.

Make more mobile friendly!

Consider using a shiv for IE support. (Or block old IE.)

Search engine optimization - page descriptions?

Look into MathML.

JavaScript effects?

Do I want to color in all of my surfaces?

Look at overfull warnings in `pdflatex` output.

Upgrade MathJax.
